bank
====

A command line banking utility.

Disclaimer
==========

This project is at its early stages, things will break. Please backup your database regularly.

Installation
============

Install it via :code:`pip` (python 3+)::

    $ pip install --allow-external pyPEG2 --allow-unverified pyPEG2 https://github.com/BenoitZugmeyer/bank/archive/master.zip

Those two pyPEG2 related flags are unfortunate but it would be resolved by `this issue`_.

    Options:
      -v, --verbose

Adaptors
========

An adaptor is a python module to download account transactions from any service. For now, only one adaptor is included.


bred
----

Interfaces with the `bred`_ french bank. :code:`bank` will prompt for an identifier and a password if you don't provide one in the configuration file.


Search query language
=====================

:code:`bank` provides a query language to quickly find transactions. For now, this is only accessible via the :code:`bank search` command.

Full text search
----------------

:code:`bank` uses the `sqlite3 fts extension`_ to search inside various fields of each transaction. By default, it searches into the description field.

:code:`gittip`
    transactions with the word 'gittip' in the description

:code:`paypal or amazon`
    transactions containing the word 'paypal' or 'amazon'

:code:`sncf or "capitaine train"`
    transactions containing the word 'sncf' or 'capitaine train' (but not 'train capitaine')

:code:`volt*`
    transactions containing a word starting with 'volt'

:code:`type:loan`
    transactions with the word 'loan' in the type field

Time search
-----------

Operators to filter transactions based on some dates.

:code:`since 2014-02-03`
    transactions since february 3rd, 2014

:code:`since 10 days`
    transactions since 10 days from now

:code:`before 2014-02-03`
    transactions before february 3rd, 2014

:code:`between 2014-01-01 and 2014-01-31`
    transactions from january 2014

Amount search
-------------

Operators to filter transactions based on the amount of the transaction.

:code:`more than 1000`
    transactions with the absolute amount being more than 1000

:code:`more than +1000`
    transactions with the amount being more than 1000

:code:`less than -1000`
    transactions with the amount being less than -1000

Combining everything
--------------------

All those predicates can be combined in a single query. The default operator is a :code:`and`.

:code:`gittip since 10 days`
    transactions containing 'gittip' within the 10 last days

:code:`amazon more than +0`
    all amazon refounds

:code:`not account:xxx or since 10 days`
    all transactions excluding those from the account id xxx if they are more than 10 days


Configuration
=============

The configuration file should be in `yaml`_ format. By default, :code:`bank` will use the file :code:`bank.yml` located in the local directory, but you can specify another path with the :code:`--config` option. All paths are relative to the configuration file

The configuration file is structured as follow:

.. code:: yaml

    # The database path. Defaults to bank.db.
    database: path_to_sqlite_database.db

    # Accounts listing.
    accounts:

        # Each account is reprensented by an ID. This ID should never change.
        XXXXXX-XXX:

            # Name of the account. You can rename it at any time.
            name: Checking account

            # Name of the adaptor to use. For now, only 'bred' is supported
            type: bred

            # Optional, the name of the session to use. Defaults to the 'type'
            # attribute
            session: my other session


        # Another account...
        YYYYYY-YYY:
            name: Hop
            type: bred

    # Optional, this lists information to send to the adaptor to authenticate
    # you. By default, all accounts of the same type will use the same session,
    # but you can specify any number of sessions you want
    sessions:

        # Default session informations to use with the 'bred' adaptor
        bred:

            # Optional, you identifier. bank will prompt it if you don't
            # provide one.
            identifier: fred

            # Optional, you password. bank will prompt it if you don't provide
            # one.
            password: xxx

        my other session:
            identifier: toto
